## About Stabolut

Stabolut is a pioneering dual-stablecoin ecosystem designed to meet the diverse needs of the global digital economy. The project features two distinct stablecoins:

*   **ESB:** A Euro-pegged, MiCA-compliant Asset-Referenced Token (ART) for the European market. It is backed by a diversified portfolio of high-quality liquid assets and approved crypto-assets.
*   **USB:** A US Dollar-pegged, decentralized, and yield-bearing stablecoin for international markets, backed by a sophisticated crypto-hedging mechanism.

The entire ecosystem is governed by the **SBL token**, which empowers community members to vote on key parameters for both ESB and USB, including risk management, treasury allocation, and new features.

This whitepaper provides a comprehensive overview of the Stabolut ecosystem, detailing the architecture, mechanisms, and tokenomics of ESB, USB, and SBL.
