**Quid Pro Stablecoin — Key Takeaways**


| Theme | Core Points |
| :-- | :-- |
| 1. Why Washington suddenly loves stablecoins | -  New Treasury Secretary Scott “BBC” Bessent faces the same dilemma as Janet Yellen: fund ~\$2 trn annual deficits plus heavy maturities without letting 10-yr yields top 5%.[^1_1]<br>-  Traditional QE is politically awkward; officials need other balance-sheet “bazookas” to absorb Treasuries while appearing anti-inflation. |
| 2. TBTF-bank stablecoins unlock trillions | -  The eight “too-big-to-fail” (TBTF) banks hold ≈\$6.8 trn in demand/time deposits.[^1_1] If customers swap those deposits for bank-issued stablecoins, the assets can be parked in T-bills.<br>-  Expected regulatory tweaks (full/partial SLR exemption for Treasuries) let banks leverage balance sheets almost cost-free, freeing ≈\$5.5 trn of buying power.[^1_1] |
| 3. Why banks will push stablecoins | -  Cost-cut: on-chain transparency plus AI-driven compliance could slash the ≈\$20 bn/yr compliance bill.[^1_1]<br>-  Higher net-interest-margin: stablecoins pay users no yield yet let banks earn T-bill returns.<br>-  No serious competition: the “Genius Act” bars Big Tech from issuing their own coins and prohibits paying interest, locking fintechs out of where the deposits are.[^1_1] |
| 4. Second liquidity valve — ending IORB | -  Fed now pays interest on reserves (IORB) totalling ≈\$3.3 trn. Congress could strip that authority (idea floated by Sen. Ted Cruz). Banks, starved of IORB, would redeploy reserves into T-bills.[^1_1] |
| 5. Total fire-power | -  Stablecoin adoption (≈\$6.8 trn) + IORB removal (≈\$3.3 trn) = **~\$10.1 trn** potential T-bill demand without calling it QE.[^1_1] |
| 6. Market implications | -  Echo of Yellen’s 2022 “Activist Treasury Issuance”: drawing down the Fed reverse-repo pool injected \$2.5 trn and turbo-charged risk assets.[^1_1]<br>-  Author expects similar liquidity waves to pump Bitcoin toward \$1 m and Nasdaq 100 toward 100k by 2028; meanwhile, TBTF-bank equities could re-rate +184% on stablecoin economics.[^1_1] |
| 7. Trading stance | -  Short-term caution: near-term Treasury-General-Account refill could drain ≈\$0.5 trn, capping Bitcoin at \$90–95k before Jackson-Hole (Aug.).[^1_1]<br>-  Long-term: stay long Bitcoin and TBTF banks; avoid betting on fintech issuers like Circle.[^1_1] |

### Author’s Bottom Line

Stablecoins aren’t a decentralised freedom tool—they are a **state-sanctioned mechanism for banks to fund government deficits** while earning free carry. Regulators will gift banks the franchise, crush non-bank competition, and unleash trillions in synthetic demand for short-dated Treasuries. Investors who wait for classic QE risk missing another multi-year melt-up in crypto and equities.

### What the rules actually forbid

| Regulation | Express ban | Who is covered | Scope of “interest” |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **MiCA (EU)** | Articles 40 \& 45 say issuers of e-money/asset-referenced tokens **and CASPs dealing with them may not “grant interest or any other benefit” that depends on how long the token is held**[^2_1][^2_2]. | Stablecoin **issuers** and any **crypto-asset service provider (CASP)** offering services on them. | Any remuneration whose size is linked to the token balance or the time it sits in the wallet. |
| **GENIUS Act (US Senate, 2025)** | A payment-stablecoin issuer **“may not pay any form of interest or yield, whether in cash, tokens, or other consideration, for merely holding”** the coin[^2_3]. | The licensed **issuer** of the payment stablecoin. | Only rewards that are “solely” for holding are barred; other benefits may be outside the ban[^2_4]. |

### Room that still exists for compensation

Because the prohibitions target *passive* remuneration for *holding*, they leave space—albeit narrow—for forms of value that are tied to **use, effort or separate products** rather than to the mere passage of time.


| Category | Why it can be permissible | Compliance guard-rails |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Spend-based rewards** (cash-back from merchants, fee rebates based on transaction volume) | Reward is triggered by *payment activity*, not by idle balances, so it is not “interest” on the stablecoin itself. | Make the formula depend on the *number* or *value* of transactions, never on how long coins sit still. |
| **Loyalty points / tier status** | Points grant discounts, VIP support, or off-chain perks that have no guaranteed cash value. | Market them as a marketing programme; avoid pegging point value 1-to-1 with fiat. |
| **Tokenised money-market funds (MMFs) or T-bill tokens offered *alongside* the stablecoin** | Yield comes from a **separate security**; the stablecoin remains yield-free. | Issue the MMF tokens under securities law; force users to execute a swap rather than auto-sweeping balances. |
| **Affiliate or third-party rewards** | GENIUS Act language leaves “affiliates” and non-issuers room to grant benefits that are *functionally similar* to interest, provided they are not the licensed issuer[^2_4]. | Keep clear legal separation; issuer must not finance or guarantee the reward pool. |
| **DeFi lending yields obtained by the user** | Under MiCA, parties *other than issuer/CASP* can still generate yield if they independently deploy their tokens[^2_5]. | Platform must not be a CASP, or must wall off the interest-bearing pool as a different asset; user, not issuer, takes counter-party risk. |

### What will **not** work

- “Autopilot” sweep that leaves the token name unchanged but quietly shares T-bill income—regulators will call it disguised interest.
- Time-based “staking” bonuses for parking the stablecoin.
- Multi-layer structures in which the issuer funds the rewards through an affiliate; regulators can pierce the veil if economics show pass-through.


### Practical checklist for product teams

1. **Separate the balance that earns yield from the balance that spends.** Force an explicit opt-in conversion.
2. **Base rewards on behaviour, not on balance duration.** Think interchange cash-back, fee holidays, or merchant coupons.
3. **Keep marketing language clean.** Never promise “earn,” “yield,” or “percentage return” on the stablecoin itself.
4. **Obtain written legal opinions** in each jurisdiction and monitor guidance—both MiCA and the GENIUS Act empower regulators to tighten definitions.
5. **Prepare for substance-over-form review.** If the economic effect mimics deposit interest, expect challenge.

**Bottom line:** You cannot pay classical yield on a MiCA- or GENIUS-compliant payment stablecoin, but you can still design *usage-linked perks or offer separate yield-bearing tokens*—provided the issuer’s role stops at maintaining the 1-to-1 stablecoin and any reward is clearly decoupled from passive holding.

### Short Answer

**Yes – a stable-coin project may “airdrop” a separate token, but only if the drop is not simply disguised interest on the stable-coin balance.**
Both MiCA (EU) and the GENIUS Act (US) allow free distributions of other crypto-assets; what they continue to forbid is any *time- or balance-linked remuneration* on the payment stable-coin itself.

## 1 | Why airdrops are not automatically banned

| Point | Explanation | Regulatory hook |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Free giveaways are outside MiCA’s “public offering” rules** | MiCA expressly exempts “free offerings, such as airdrops”, provided the recipient gives no consideration (money, data, fees)[^3_1]. | MiCA Recital 58 \& Art. 4(2) |
| **GENIUS Act targets *interest*, not promotional gifts** | The Act forbids the *issuer* from paying “any form of interest or yield … for merely holding” the stable-coin, but says nothing about one-off promotional distributions of a different asset[^3_2]. | GENIUS Act §4(g) |

## 2 | Where the red line sits

An airdrop **crosses the line** and becomes prohibited “interest/other benefit” if:

* the number of tokens airdropped **scales with the size or age** of the user’s stable-coin balance;
* drops occur **periodically** (e.g., monthly) in lieu of yield;
* the issuer funds the drop from the stable-coin reserve spread, making it an economic pass-through.


## 3 | Designing a compliant airdrop

| Design lever | Keeps you compliant |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Event-based, not balance-based** | Reward a one-time milestone – e.g., first on-chain payment, KYC completion, or attending a launch event – rather than idle holding. |
| **Fixed quota per wallet** | Make the drop equal for all eligible wallets (e.g., 100 promo tokens each) so it is not a return on assets. |
| **Separate legal entity or third-party sponsor** | If a group affiliate funds the drop, ensure the stable-coin issuer neither guarantees nor finances it, and that marketing avoids implying a yield promise. |
| **Clear disclaimers** | State that the new token is *not* backed by the stable-coin reserve, may have no monetary value, and is not interest. |
| **No automatic accrual** | Require users to **claim** the token within a window; do not sweep it straight into the wallet in proportion to balances. |

## 4 | Other compliance checkpoints

* **Securities analysis** – if the airdropped token has profit-sharing or governance features, analyse under EU Prospectus Regulation / US securities law.
* **AML/KYC** – distributions to self-hosted wallets are still subject to travel-rule thresholds; keep records.
* **Tax** – many jurisdictions treat airdrops as taxable income at fair-market value on receipt.
* **Consumer protection** – publish a plain-language risk summary and avoid implying capital guarantee.


### Bottom Line

Airdropping a **different** coin remains a lawful marketing tool under both MiCA and the GENIUS Act, *so long as the drop is not pegged to how long or how much of the stable-coin a user holds*. Structure it as a one-off, usage-linked perk and keep the stable-coin itself yield-free.

# How about I give a token that have voting power (but more holding, more voting power) to in a  future unlock an airdrop?

**Short answer:** *This design is almost certainly **prohibited** under both MiCA and the U-S GENIUS Act, because the “governance” token ends up functioning as **balance-linked, time-linked remuneration** for the stable-coin.* ​

### 1  Why regulators will treat it as disguised interest

| Regulatory lens | Key test | How your plan fails |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **MiCA Art. 40 \& 45 (“no interest or any other benefit”)** | “Benefit” covers *anything whose size depends on the amount or duration of stable-coin held.* | Voting weight (and therefore the later airdrop) **scales with the stable-coin balance and how long it remains unspent** → a *benefit for mere holding*. |
| **GENIUS Act §4(g)** | Issuer may not pay “any form of interest or yield … for merely holding.” | Extra voting power → larger share of future drops. That economic value flows **solely from holding**, so it is forbidden “yield.” |
| **Substance-over-form doctrine (EU \& US)** | Authorities ignore labels and look at economic reality. | Calling it “governance” cannot disguise the fact that the token is **accruing economic value pro-rata to idle balances**. |

### 2  Why “voting power” does not save you

1. **Voting ≠ utility** if the vote’s only practical effect is to decide who gets more of the airdrop pot.
2. Even if there are *other* proposals, tying *voting weight* to *deposit size and tenure* still grants a **quantifiable, transferable monetary advantage**.
3. Precedents:
    * SEC’s *Tomahawk* order (2018) treated bounty tokens as securities because recipients got them “in exchange for services designed to advance issuer’s economic interests” — here the “service” is parking cash[^4_1].
    * EU EBA draft RTS on MiCA (2024) says any mechanism that “rewards retention” is an interest proxy[^4_2].

### 3  What would be compliant alternatives?

| Compliant concept | How to keep it legal |
| :-- | :-- |
| **One-person-one-vote utility token** | Each wallet gets equal governance weight **regardless of balance**. Any later drop must also be *flat per wallet* or task-based. |
| **Spend-weighted rewards** | Allocate voting points or coupons **per transaction** (activity), not per average balance. |
| **Separate yield-bearing token** | Users **explicitly swap** stable-coins into a tokenised MMF/T-bill fund that is regulated as a security; stable-coin itself stays yield-free. |
| **Airdrop based on off-chain effort** | Example: completing KYC, onboarding merchants, code contributions. None ties to how much or how long users hold the coin. |

### 4  Practical checklist if you still want governance

1. **Decouple voting weight from holdings.** Use quadratic or per-address caps.
2. **Document legal analysis** showing no remuneration for passive holding; keep board minutes.
3. **Disclose in white-paper** that the governance token carries *no expectation of economic return*; stamp this on marketing.
4. **Ring-fence airdrop budget** in a separate entity that is not funded by the stable-coin reserve spread.
5. **Obtain advance comfort** from your competent authority (OCC or EU home regulator); MiCA allows formal “no interest” opinions.

### Bottom line

A “more coins = more votes = bigger future airdrop” scheme is a textbook attempt to smuggle yield into a payment stable-coin. Both MiCA and the GENIUS Act ban it. Redesign the incentive so that value flows from *use* or a *separate opt-in investment*, not from simply sitting on the stable-coin.

## Would a Balance-Linked Voting Token with Future Airdrop Work in Hong Kong?

### Key Points from Hong Kong’s Stablecoin Law

- **Interest Prohibition:** Hong Kong’s new Stablecoins Ordinance, effective August 1, 2025, **explicitly prohibits stablecoin issuers from paying interest or “interest-like” returns** to holders. “Interest” is broadly defined to include any profit, income, or other return that arises from the *length of time* a stablecoin is held, the *amount* held, or the *market value* of the stablecoin[^5_1][^5_2][^5_3][^5_4].
- **Scope of the Ban:** The law covers not just cash interest, but any benefit or incentive that is *functionally equivalent* to interest—meaning any reward, bonus, or token whose value or allocation is based on how much or how long a user holds the stablecoin[^5_4].
- **Marketing and Compliance:** Only licensed stablecoin issuers can operate, and all marketing of unlicensed stablecoins is banned. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will issue further guidelines, but the law already sets a high bar for compliance and consumer protection[^5_2][^5_5][^5_6].


### Application to Your Proposed Scheme

| Feature | Would It Be Allowed? | Reasoning |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Airdrop of a separate token** | *Potentially allowed* | If the airdrop is a one-off, not based on balance or holding period, and not funded from stablecoin reserves, it may be permitted as a marketing or promotional activity. |
| **Token with voting power, where more holding = more votes** | *Not allowed* | If voting power (and thus future airdrop allocation) is tied to the amount or duration of stablecoin held, this is considered a form of “interest-like” benefit and is prohibited under the Ordinance[^5_4]. |
| **Future airdrop based on voting power** | *Not allowed* | If the airdrop is distributed in proportion to voting power, and voting power is itself balance- or time-linked, this is a disguised yield and would be banned[^5_4]. |

### What Is Permitted?

- **Flat, event-based airdrops:** You may airdrop a governance or utility token to all users equally, or based on specific actions (e.g., KYC, first transaction), but *not* based on how much or how long they hold the stablecoin.
- **Voting tokens with equal weight:** You can issue a governance token with one-person-one-vote, or with voting rights based on activity (not balance or tenure).
- **Separate yield products:** If users explicitly opt in to a separate, regulated investment product (e.g., a tokenized money market fund), that is possible—but the stablecoin itself must remain yield-free.


### Summary Table

| Scheme Component | HK Law Status | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Balance-linked voting token | **Prohibited** | Treated as interest-like benefit[^5_4] |
| Time-linked airdrop | **Prohibited** | Treated as interest-like benefit[^5_4] |
| Flat, event-based airdrop | **Permitted** | If not linked to balance or holding period |
| Separate yield token (opt-in) | **Permitted** | Must be regulated as a security |

### Bottom Line

**Hong Kong’s stablecoin law is as strict as MiCA and the GENIUS Act on this point:** any scheme that gives users more voting power or future airdrop allocation based on how much or how long they hold a stablecoin is considered a prohibited “interest-like” benefit. Only usage-based, event-based, or flat-per-wallet rewards are allowed[^5_1][^5_2][^5_3][^5_4].

# Think in ideas to reward users based on their holdings but can be legal

Now I have sufficient information to provide a comprehensive answer about legal reward structures for stablecoin holders that comply with current regulations. Let me compile this information into a detailed response covering various compliant reward mechanisms.

# Legal Reward Structures for Stablecoin Holders

Based on regulatory frameworks in MiCA (EU), the GENIUS Act (US), and Hong Kong's stablecoin laws, here are several **compliant approaches** to reward users based on their holdings without violating interest prohibitions:

## Transaction-Based Rewards

**Spend-based cashback programs** represent the most straightforward legal approach. These rewards are triggered by payment activity rather than passive holding[^6_1][^6_2][^6_3].


| Reward Type | Structure | Compliance Factor |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Merchant Cashback** | 1-5% back on qualifying purchases | Reward depends on *transaction volume*, not balance duration[^6_1] |
| **Category Bonuses** | Enhanced rates for specific merchant types | Based on *usage patterns*, not holdings[^6_4][^6_5] |
| **Fee Rebates** | Reduced transaction fees for active users | Tied to *payment frequency*, not balance size[^6_6] |

Companies like **Crypto.com** and **Mastercard** already implement these models, where users earn cryptocurrency rewards for spending rather than holding[^6_7][^6_5].

## Activity-Based Incentive Programs

**Performance-linked rewards** connect compensation to specific user behaviors rather than passive balance maintenance[^6_8][^6_9].

### Digital Engagement Rewards

- **Social media sharing bonuses** for promoting the platform
- **Referral rewards** for bringing new users
- **Educational completion bonuses** for finishing compliance training
- **Platform interaction rewards** for using specific features


### Milestone-Based Rewards

- **First transaction bonus** - one-time reward for initial platform usage
- **Volume milestones** - rewards for reaching cumulative transaction thresholds
- **Streak bonuses** - rewards for consistent platform usage over time

These approaches comply because they reward *effort and engagement* rather than *time-based holding*[^6_8].

## Loyalty Token Programs

**Separate utility tokens** can be distributed as loyalty rewards, provided they don't function as disguised interest on the stablecoin[^6_9][^6_10].

### Compliant Token Design

- **Fixed allocation per user** regardless of stablecoin balance
- **Governance-only tokens** with no monetary value expectation
- **Utility tokens** providing platform access or discounts
- **Collectible tokens** (NFTs) for achievement recognition


### Legal Safeguards

- **Separate legal entity** issues the loyalty tokens
- **Clear disclaimers** that tokens are not backed by stablecoin reserves
- **No automatic accrual** - users must actively claim rewards
- **Transparent valuation** showing tokens have no guaranteed monetary value


## Subscription and Tier-Based Benefits

**Membership models** can provide enhanced services based on platform usage rather than balance-based rewards[^6_11][^6_9].

### Service Tier Benefits

- **Premium customer support** for active users
- **Exclusive platform features** based on usage patterns
- **Educational content access** for engaged community members
- **Event invitations** for platform contributors


### Subscription Models

- **Fee-free trading** for users meeting activity thresholds
- **Enhanced security features** for verified active users
- **Priority customer service** for frequent platform users


## Partnership and Affiliate Programs

**Third-party rewards** can be structured to avoid direct issuer involvement while still providing value to users[^6_1][^6_12].

### Merchant Partnership Programs

- **Exclusive discounts** from partner merchants
- **Special access** to partner platforms or services
- **Co-branded experiences** that don't involve direct monetary rewards
- **Preferential pricing** on partner products


### Affiliate Network Benefits

- **Cashback from external partners** that flows through separate entities
- **Rewards from affiliated businesses** with independent funding
- **Cross-platform utility** through partner ecosystem participation


## Gamification and Competition

**Achievement-based systems** can provide recognition and utility without constituting interest payments[^6_13][^6_9].

### Gamified Elements

- **Leaderboards** for most active users
- **Achievement badges** for completing platform tasks
- **Competition prizes** for platform engagement contests
- **Community recognition** for valuable contributions


### Skill-Based Rewards

- **Educational quiz rewards** for demonstrating platform knowledge
- **Community contribution rewards** for helpful forum participation
- **Bug bounty programs** for platform improvement suggestions


## Compliance Checkpoints

To ensure legal compliance, any reward program should include:

### Legal Structure Requirements

- **Separate reward pools** not funded by stablecoin reserves
- **Independent legal entities** managing reward distribution
- **Clear documentation** showing rewards are not interest equivalents
- **Regular legal review** of program structures


### Operational Safeguards

- **Explicit user consent** for reward program participation
- **Transparent terms** explaining reward mechanics
- **Regular audits** of reward distribution practices
- **Compliance monitoring** for regulatory changes


### Marketing and Communications

- **Clear disclaimers** about reward nature and limitations
- **Transparent reporting** of reward program economics
- **Educational materials** explaining legal compliance approach
- **Regular updates** on program changes and compliance status


## Implementation Strategy

**Start with transaction-based rewards** as the most legally certain approach, then gradually expand to other compliant models based on regulatory comfort and user adoption[^6_1][^6_3].

### Phase 1: Core Transaction Rewards

- Launch merchant cashback program
- Implement fee rebate structure
- Establish referral reward system


### Phase 2: Enhanced Engagement

- Add milestone-based rewards
- Introduce loyalty token system
- Develop partnership programs


### Phase 3: Advanced Features

- Implement gamification elements
- Launch subscription tier benefits
- Expand ecosystem partnerships

The key principle across all approaches is ensuring rewards flow from **user activity and engagement** rather than **passive holding of stablecoins**. This fundamental distinction allows creative reward structures while maintaining regulatory compliance across major jurisdictions[^6_14][^6_15][^6_16].

## Are Algorithmic Stablecoins Banned?

### European Union (MiCA)

- **Algorithmic stablecoins are explicitly banned under the EU’s MiCA regulation.**
    - MiCA only permits stablecoins that are fully backed by liquid, traditional assets at a 1:1 ratio.
    - Algorithmic stablecoins, which rely on market mechanisms or algorithms rather than explicit reserves, are not recognized as asset-referenced tokens and cannot be issued, offered, or listed in the EU[^7_1][^7_2][^7_3][^7_4][^7_5][^7_6].


### United States (GENIUS Act)

- **Algorithmic stablecoins face a de facto ban under the GENIUS Act.**
    - The Act requires all payment stablecoins to be backed by high-quality liquid assets and prohibits non-fiat-backed models, such as algorithmic stablecoins like TerraUSD[^7_7][^7_8].
    - There is a temporary ban in place, pending further studies on the risks and regulatory treatment of algorithmic stablecoins. Until these studies are complete and new rules are issued, algorithmic stablecoins cannot be issued in compliance with the law[^7_9][^7_7][^7_8][^7_10].


### Hong Kong

- **Algorithmic stablecoins are effectively banned under Hong Kong’s new Stablecoins Ordinance (effective August 2025).**
    - The law requires all stablecoins to be fully backed by high-quality, liquid reserve assets at all times.
    - Stablecoins that derive their value from arbitrage or algorithms, without explicit reserves, do not meet licensing requirements and cannot be issued or offered in Hong Kong[^7_11][^7_12][^7_13][^7_14].
    - The regulatory focus is on fiat-referenced stablecoins, and algorithmic models are excluded from the licensing regime.


### Summary Table

| Jurisdiction | Algorithmic Stablecoins Status | Key Reason |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **EU (MiCA)** | **Banned** | Only asset-backed stablecoins allowed[^7_1][^7_2][^7_3][^7_4][^7_5][^7_6] |
| **US (GENIUS Act)** | **Temporarily banned** | Only fiat-backed, fully reserved stablecoins permitted; further study required[^7_9][^7_7][^7_8][^7_10] |
| **Hong Kong** | **Banned** | Only fully reserved, fiat-referenced stablecoins licensed[^7_11][^7_12][^7_13][^7_14] |

**Bottom line:** Algorithmic stablecoins are banned or excluded from licensing in all major regulated markets (EU, US, Hong Kong) as of mid-2025. Only fully asset-backed stablecoins are permitted under these new legal frameworks.

## Jurisdictions Allowing Yield-Bearing Stablecoins (as of July 2025)

While most major markets (EU, US, Hong Kong, UK, Japan) prohibit yield or interest payments on stablecoins, a few territories have adopted a more permissive approach. Here are the key jurisdictions where yield-bearing stablecoins are currently allowed:

### 1. **Bahrain**

- **Regulatory Status:** The Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) issued comprehensive stablecoin regulations in July 2025.
- **Yield Allowance:** Licensed issuers may offer yield-bearing stablecoins that pay passive returns to clients. The yield must come from interest or rewards earned on the investment of reserve assets (e.g., bank deposits, government securities).
- **Requirements:**
    - Only fully fiat-backed stablecoins (Bahraini Dinar, USD, or other approved fiat) are permitted.
    - Issuers must maintain a 1:1 reserve ratio with high-quality, liquid assets.
    - The yield rate must be “reasonable” and not threaten the stability of the stablecoin or the issuer’s financial health.
    - Strict licensing, audit, and compliance standards apply[^8_1][^8_2][^8_3].


### 2. **United States (SEC-Registered Securities Only)**

- **General Rule:** Under the GENIUS Act and anticipated STABLE Act, payment stablecoins cannot pay yield unless registered as securities.
- **Exception:** The SEC has approved specific yield-bearing stablecoins as registered securities (e.g., Figure Markets’ YLDS stablecoin).
    - These products pay a regulated yield and are available to U.S. retail and institutional investors.
    - Such stablecoins are subject to full securities law compliance, including disclosures and investor protections.
- **Note:** Most mainstream stablecoins (USDC, USDT) do **not** pay yield; only SEC-registered products can legally do so[^8_4][^8_5][^8_6].


### 3. **Other Notable Regions**

- **Singapore:** The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) requires stablecoins to be fully backed and promptly redeemable. There is no explicit ban on yield, but in practice, MAS-regulated stablecoins are not marketed as yield-bearing. Yield is typically offered through separate, regulated investment products, not directly on the stablecoin[^8_7].
- **UAE:** The UAE Central Bank allows only AED stablecoins for payments and does not currently permit yield-bearing stablecoins[^8_2].
- **DeFi Platforms (Global):** Yield on stablecoins is still available through decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, but these are not regulated or licensed as payment stablecoins in any major jurisdiction and carry significant legal and counterparty risks[^8_8].


## Summary Table

| Jurisdiction | Yield-Bearing Stablecoins Allowed? | Key Conditions/Notes |
| :-- | :--: | :-- |
| **Bahrain** | Yes | Licensed, fiat-backed, yield from reserve assets[^8_2][^8_3] |
| **USA (SEC-registered)** | Yes (as securities) | Must register as a security, full compliance[^8_4][^8_5][^8_6] |
| **Singapore** | Not directly | Yield via separate products, not on stablecoin[^8_7] |
| **UAE** | No | Only AED stablecoins, no yield[^8_2] |
| **EU, HK, UK, Japan** | No | Explicitly banned |

### Key Takeaways

- **Bahrain** is the most prominent jurisdiction openly allowing yield-bearing stablecoins under a clear regulatory framework.
- **The US** allows yield-bearing stablecoins only if they are registered as securities, not as payment stablecoins.
- **Most other major markets** prohibit yield on stablecoins, requiring any yield to be offered through separate, regulated investment products.

If you are seeking to issue or use a yield-bearing stablecoin, Bahrain currently offers the clearest legal path, while the US provides a route via securities registration. Most other regions remain restrictive.

## What Does "Only Asset-Backed Stablecoins Allowed" Mean?

When a regulation or law states that **only asset-backed stablecoins are allowed**, it means that **every stablecoin must be fully backed by real, tangible assets held in reserve**. The value of each stablecoin token must be directly tied to the value of these underlying assets, and the issuer must be able to redeem the stablecoin for the corresponding asset at any time.

### Key Features of Asset-Backed Stablecoins

- **Collateralization:** Each stablecoin is backed 1:1 by assets such as fiat currency (e.g., USD, EUR), government bonds, commodities (like gold), or sometimes other cryptocurrencies. For every token in circulation, there is an equivalent value held in reserve[^9_1][^9_2][^9_3].
- **Transparency:** Issuers are required to provide regular audits and public disclosures to prove that the reserves exist and match the number of tokens issued[^9_1][^9_2].
- **Redemption Mechanism:** Users must be able to exchange their stablecoins for the underlying asset at any time, ensuring the peg is maintained[^9_1][^9_2].
- **No Algorithmic Backing:** Stablecoins that rely on algorithms or market mechanisms (without real asset reserves) to maintain their value are not permitted under these rules[^9_4][^9_5][^9_2].


### Why Are Algorithmic Stablecoins Excluded?

- **Algorithmic stablecoins** use computer programs and supply adjustments to try to keep their value stable, but they are not backed by real assets. This makes them riskier and more prone to collapse, as seen in several high-profile failures[^9_4][^9_5].
- Regulations like the EU’s MiCA, the US GENIUS Act, and Hong Kong’s stablecoin law require **full, liquid asset reserves** to protect users and ensure stability[^9_2][^9_3].


### Examples

| Type | Backing Mechanism | Allowed? |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **USDC, USDT, EURC** | 1:1 backed by fiat reserves | **Yes** |
| **PAXG** | Backed by physical gold | **Yes** |
| **DAI (crypto-collateralized)** | Overcollateralized by crypto | Sometimes (if reserves are real and transparent) |
| **TerraUSD (UST)** | Algorithmic, no real reserves | **No** |
| **Ampleforth, FRAX** | Algorithmic, supply adjustments | **No** |

### Regulatory Requirements (e.g., MiCA)

- **Full Reserve Backing:** Stablecoins must be backed by liquid reserves (cash, government bonds) equal to the total supply[^9_2][^9_6].
- **Third-Party Custody:** Reserves must be held by a trusted, independent custodian[^9_2].
- **Regular Audits:** Issuers must publish regular reports proving the existence and adequacy of reserves[^9_2].
- **Redemption Rights:** Users must be able to redeem stablecoins for the underlying asset at any time[^9_3].

**In summary:**
"Only asset-backed stablecoins allowed" means that every stablecoin must be fully and transparently backed by real, liquid assets—no algorithmic or unbacked models are permitted. This is intended to ensure stability, protect users, and prevent the risks seen with algorithmic stablecoins[^9_4][^9_1][^9_2][^9_3].

## Can a Stablecoin Fully Hedged Against Bitcoin Price Comply with the US GENIUS Act or Hong Kong Law?

### Short Answer

**No, a stablecoin that is “fully backed by liquid hedging against bitcoin price” (i.e., using derivatives or positions that offset bitcoin price risk) would not meet the reserve requirements under either the US GENIUS Act or Hong Kong’s stablecoin law—even if, at any moment, closing all positions would yield more assets than tokens issued.**

### US GENIUS Act: Reserve Asset Requirements

- **Permitted Reserve Assets:** The GENIUS Act requires that all payment stablecoins be backed 1:1 by “highly liquid and safe instruments.” These are strictly defined as:
    - US dollars (cash)
    - Insured bank deposits
    - Short-term US Treasury bills
    - Overnight repos and reverse repos backed by Treasuries
    - Money market funds holding only the above assets
    - Central bank reserves
    - Any other similar government-issued asset approved by regulators
- **Prohibited Reserve Assets:** The Act does **not** permit reserves to be held in:
    - Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency
    - Derivatives, futures, or options contracts (even if used for hedging)
    - Synthetic or algorithmic positions, or any asset whose value is not directly and immediately redeemable in fiat or government securities
- **Rationale:** The law is designed to ensure that stablecoin holders can always redeem at par value, with no market or counterparty risk. Even a perfectly hedged position against bitcoin price is not considered “highly liquid” or “safe” in the regulatory sense[^10_1][^10_2][^10_3][^10_4][^10_5][^10_6].


### Hong Kong Stablecoin Law: Reserve Asset Requirements

- **Permitted Reserve Assets:** Hong Kong’s new stablecoin regime (effective August 2025) requires:
    - Full reserve backing at all times, with assets equal to or greater than the par value of tokens issued
    - Reserves must be “high quality, highly liquid, and carry minimal investment risk”
    - Acceptable reserves include: cash, short-term bank deposits, high-grade government or central bank securities, and certain overnight repos
- **Prohibited Reserve Assets:** The law **does not** allow:
    - Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as reserves
    - Derivatives, futures, or any synthetic hedging positions as reserves
    - Any asset with significant market, credit, or liquidity risk
- **Rationale:** The focus is on ensuring immediate, risk-free redemption for users. Hedging strategies, no matter how effective, do not substitute for holding actual, approved reserve assets[^10_7][^10_8][^10_9][^10_10][^10_5][^10_11].


### Why Hedging Against Bitcoin Price Is Not Sufficient

- **Regulatory Definitions:** Both regimes require reserves to be held in specific, regulator-approved asset classes. The “proof” that closing all positions would cover liabilities is not relevant if the assets themselves are not on the approved list.
- **No Substitution by Derivatives:** Even if a hedged position is perfectly constructed, derivatives are not considered “high quality, highly liquid” reserves for the purpose of stablecoin backing.
- **No Crypto or Synthetic Exposure:** Both the US and Hong Kong frameworks are designed to exclude crypto or synthetic exposure from the reserve base, regardless of the risk management sophistication.


### Table: Reserve Asset Eligibility

| Asset Type | US GENIUS Act | Hong Kong Law | Notes |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :-- |
| US Dollars / HKD (cash) | ✔️ | ✔️ | Fully allowed |
| Short-term government securities | ✔️ | ✔️ | Fully allowed |
| Bank deposits | ✔️ | ✔️ | Fully allowed |
| Bitcoin or other crypto | ❌ | ❌ | Not allowed |
| Derivatives (futures, options) | ❌ | ❌ | Not allowed, even for hedging |
| Synthetic/hedged positions | ❌ | ❌ | Not allowed, regardless of effectiveness |

### Conclusion

**A stablecoin that is “fully backed by liquid hedging against bitcoin price” cannot be licensed or marketed as a payment stablecoin under either the US GENIUS Act or Hong Kong’s stablecoin law.** Only reserves held in regulator-approved, highly liquid, and low-risk assets (cash, government securities, etc.) are permitted. Crypto, derivatives, or synthetic hedges are categorically excluded—even if they could, in theory, cover all liabilities at any time[^10_1][^10_2][^10_7][^10_8][^10_9][^10_10][^10_3][^10_4][^10_5][^10_11][^10_6].

## Can a Stablecoin Fully Backed by Liquid Hedging Against Bitcoin Price Comply with MiCA?

### MiCA Reserve Requirements: Core Principles

- **Full Reserve Backing:** MiCA requires that all stablecoins (both E-Money Tokens and Asset-Referenced Tokens) be fully backed by a reserve of assets that is at least equal to the value of all tokens in circulation[^11_1][^11_2][^11_3].
- **Permitted Reserve Assets:** The reserve must consist of *highly liquid, low-risk assets*. For E-Money Tokens, this means cash, bank deposits, and certain government securities denominated in the same currency as the token. For Asset-Referenced Tokens, the reserve can include a broader basket (fiat, commodities, possibly some crypto), but only if these assets are themselves highly liquid and low risk[^11_1][^11_2][^11_3].
- **Custody and Segregation:** Reserves must be held with eligible custodians (e.g., regulated banks or investment firms), segregated from the issuer’s own assets, and subject to regular audits and reporting[^11_1][^11_2].


### Are Hedging Strategies or Derivatives Allowed as Reserves?

- **No Substitution by Hedging or Derivatives:** MiCA does **not** permit the use of derivatives, futures, options, or synthetic hedging positions as reserve assets for stablecoins. The regulation requires that reserves be held in *actual, tangible assets*—not in positions that merely offset risk or are “proven” to cover liabilities if closed[^11_1][^11_3].
- **No Crypto or Synthetic Exposure:** The reserve must be directly and immediately redeemable in the referenced asset (e.g., fiat, government bonds). Even if a hedging strategy could, in theory, cover all liabilities, it does not meet the requirement for “highly liquid, low-risk” reserves[^11_1][^11_3].
- **Restrictions on Crypto Assets:** For Asset-Referenced Tokens, some crypto assets may be included in the reserve, but only if they are themselves highly liquid and low risk, and only as a minority component. Bitcoin or derivatives based on bitcoin price are not considered eligible reserve assets for the purpose of backing a stablecoin under MiCA[^11_2].


### Summary Table: MiCA Reserve Asset Eligibility

| Asset Type | MiCA Status | Notes |
| :-- | :--: | :-- |
| Cash (fiat) | ✔️ | Fully allowed |
| Bank deposits | ✔️ | Fully allowed |
| Short-term government securities | ✔️ | Fully allowed |
| Bitcoin or other crypto (majority) | ❌ | Not allowed as main reserve |
| Derivatives (futures, options) | ❌ | Not allowed, even for hedging |
| Synthetic/hedged positions | ❌ | Not allowed, regardless of effectiveness |

### Key Takeaway

**MiCA does not allow a stablecoin to be “fully backed by liquid hedging against bitcoin price” as a substitute for holding actual, regulator-approved reserve assets.** Only real, highly liquid, low-risk assets—such as cash, bank deposits, and government securities—are permitted as reserves. Hedging strategies, derivatives, or synthetic positions do not qualify, even if they could theoretically cover all liabilities at any time[^11_1][^11_2][^11_3].
